# [I Love It When](https://github.com/devinepk/ILoveItWhen)
By Philip Devine

## Why "I Love It When":
Social media is great, but it’s really about getting other people’s opinion about what you just shared, and can leave you feeling pretty empty.  

Instead of posting things to get affirmation from other people, I wanted to create a place where I could go back and remember people, places, and experiences I love.
